# Complete the check_password function that accepts a

# A password is valid if it meets all of these criteria
#   * It must have at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
#   * It must have at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
#   * It must have at least one digit (0-9)
#   * It must have at least one special character $, !, or @
#   * It must have six or more characters in it
#   * It must have twelve or fewer characters in it
#
# The string object has some methods that you may want to use,
# like ".isalpha", ".isdigit", ".isupper", and ".islower"

# input -> string password to be checked

# have a counter. I would like it such that if the counter is Greater than 0. than something is wrong. This means I need to add to it, if a condition is not met....
# maybe its better if I add to it, if the condition IS met...

# loop to find casing. need at last one lower case

# loop to find digit

# loop to find one character (find char value of signature)

# loop to find length check

# may need to use break/condinue


#output -> True or False if the string meets ALL criteria
